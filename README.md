# Walmart Retail Dashboard

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a dynamic retail dashboard using Walmart's sales data, aimed at providing comprehensive insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, customer behaviors, and profitability. The dashboard is designed for quick and interactive exploration of retail data to aid in decision-making.

## Overview
This dashboard was built using data from Walmart’s retail operations, encompassing various categories such as **orders, customers, products, and returns**. The data has been processed and visualized to provide insights across several dimensions, including sales, profits, discounting strategies, and customer returns.

Key metrics tracked in the dashboard include:
- **Total Sales**
- **Total Profit**
- **Quantity Sold**
- **Average Discount**
- **Total Orders**
- **Profitability**

Additionally, the dashboard answers several key business questions:
1. **KPIs**: Total sales, profit, quantity, number of orders, and profit margin.
2. **Sales and Profit Analysis**: Comparative analysis of sales and profit across time periods and categories.
3. **Category-wise Profit**: Breakdown of profits by category and subcategory.
4. **Sales by Country**: Analysis of sales distribution by country and region.
5. **Top 5 and Bottom 5 Subcategories**: Identification of best- and worst-performing product subcategories.
6. **Yearly Sales Trend**: Visual representation of sales trends over the years.
7. **Return Analysis**: Insights into the percentage of orders that were returned.
8. **Top and Bottom Customers**: Identification of high-value and low-value customers.
